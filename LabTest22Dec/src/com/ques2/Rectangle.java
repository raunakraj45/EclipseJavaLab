/*
 * Program: Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members 'length' and 'breadth' and
 * two methods to print the area and perimeter of the rectangle respectively.
 * Its constructor having parameters for length and breadth is used to initialize length and
 * breadth of the rectangle. Let class 'Square' inherit the 'Rectangle'
 * class with its constructor having a parameter for its side (suppose s) 
 * calling the constructor of its parent class as 'super(s,s)'. Print the area and
 * perimeter of a rectangle and a square.
